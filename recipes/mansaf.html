    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Mansaf</strong> is considered the national dish of Jordan and is a staple in traditional Jordanian cuisine. It's a hearty, flavorful dish that features tender lamb cooked in a <em>yogurt sauce and server on top of a bed of fragrant rice</em>, garnished with toasted almonds and pine nuts.</p>

    <p>The dish is typically served on special occasions, such as weddings or holidays, and is often accompanied by flatbread and a side salad.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 kg lamb shoulder or leg, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups long-grain rice</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup toasted almonds</li>
        <li>1/4 cup toasted pine nuts</li>
        <li>Flatbread and salad, to server</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, brown the lamb over medium-high heat until golden brown on all sides. Add the onion and garlic and saute until softened.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the yogurt, cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Pour the yogurt mixture over the lamb and add enough water to cover the meat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1-2 hours, until the lamb is tender and the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, rinse the rice several times until the water runs clear. Add the water and a pinch of salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes, until the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed.</li>
        <li>To serve, spread the cooked rice on a large platter and top with the cooked lamb and sauce. Garnish with toasted almonds and pine nuts, and serve with flatbread and a side salad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
